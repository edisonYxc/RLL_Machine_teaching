This code contains the implementation of experiment - 'RLL MSc Projects - Machine Teaching (Evaluation of Robotic Teaching)'; Registered with Review Reference:	MRSU-20/21-24777

This code is only for study purpose 

Properties list in line 28 to line 57 are the variables used in this implementation, since the design of MATLAB App Designer to use these variable should obey "app.property" format

Property node 1 to node 12 are the variable for 12 target nodes shown in the experiment
         temp is the private access used for record node location from dropdown list and transfer to demo button function
         temp0 to temp4 is the variable which store the degree for each column on target nodes
         data is the matrix which contain all the data
         a to a3 is the predicted slope for reproduction
         rightNow is the variable to record the time when user turn on the experiment switch and start the experiment
         howlong is the variable to record the time when user turn off the experiment switch and end the experiment
         record is the matrix records all the user input
         score_record is the matrix records user's teaching score
         
         
function startupFcn(app): build the experiment environment, display all target nodes once run the program

function SelectnodeDropDownValueChanged(app, event): detect the user input and save the user input to app.temp save the slope of the user input to app.temp0

function DemonstrateButtonPushed(app, event): function for demonstrate button, a_regulation, b_regulation, c_regulation is the regulation term for regression prediction; 
         scatter function is used for plot reproductions; app.a is the variable for the regression prediction; error_1 to error_12 are varables to calculate the error rate for each 
         predicted trajectory; app.error is the total error rate; sec is the variable for time cost; app.ScoreEditField.Value is the variable for teaching scores
         
         Lines 242 to line 10687 is the suggestion database for three user attempts 
         
function ClearButtonPushed(app, event): is used for clear output windows after each demonstration

function ScoreEditFieldValueChanged(app, event): is a front-end UI to display score in score box
          
function StartSwitchValueChanged(app, event): is a front-end UI, to trigger the timer once experiment start

function ScoreTextAreaValueChanged(app, event): is a front-end UI, but the text output is programmed in function DemonstrateButtonPushed(app, event) for coding logic reasons

function updateAppLayout(app, event): is a back-end setting for the locations of each UI

function createComponents(app): generate each UI

methods (Access = public): public data flow which can be viewed outside of the program

methods (Access = private): private data flow which allow data flow like user input to transfer in each function
